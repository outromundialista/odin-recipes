    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>7 cups water</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 bags black tea (or 1 Tbsp loose tea)</li>
        <li>1 cup unpasteurized, unflavored store-bought kombucha</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make Some Tea:</strong> Bring water to a boil and add your tea. Let it steep for about 15 minutes, then remove the tea and stir in sugar. Let it cool to room temperature—only when the water is at room temperature is it ready to work with.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Starter Kombucha:</strong> Pour the sweetened tea into your jar, then pour store-bought kombucha in, making sure to include any little gunkies that may be at the bottom – these are yeast! (This is the only time you’ll ever need to buy a bottle of kombucha – after this point you’ll be making your own starter!)</li>
        <li><strong>Ferment: </strong> with a cloth to keep out bugs and debris, and secure with a rubber band. Set somewhere dark, still, and room temperature (70-75°F), like a cupboard, for 1 to 4 weeks, until a ¼ inch SCOBY has formed.</li>
